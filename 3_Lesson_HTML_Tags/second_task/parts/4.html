    <h1>4 - Flying Blind</h1>
    <p>On 2 October 1996, shortly after take off, the crew of Aeroper√∫ Flight 603 are confused by false speed and altitude readings and contradictory warnings from the aircraft's air data system. In preparation for an emergency landing, the crew descend the aircraft, but unknowingly descend too far by relying on the false readings. The Boeing 757 crashes into the Pacific Ocean, killing everyone on board. The false readings and contradictory warnings were caused by duct tape over the static ports, which was used to protect the ports during maintenance, but was not removed afterwards.</p>
