    <h1>3 - Fire on Board</h1>
    <p>On 2 September 1998, a fire breaks out on Swissair Flight 111 while in flight, damaging vital systems and causing the aircraft to crash into the Atlantic Ocean off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, with no survivors. The fire was caused by faulty wiring in the on-board first-class and business-class entertainment systems.</p>
